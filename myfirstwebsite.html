				<p>Meditation is one of the most common practices for stress reduction.<br>
					<br>
					Deep breathing and clearing the mind helps you feel more relaxed.
					<br>
					<br>
				 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395196" target="_blank">One study</a> performed in 2012 showed that meditation programs improved the quality of life for over 3,000 participants.<br>
				<h2><li>Exercise</li></h2>

				<p>Exercise is a great way to reduce stress because it pumps up your endorphins, feel-good neurotransmitters. 
					<br>
					<br>
					It also increases your overall phyical health by releasing that extra stress-induced adrenaline.
					<br>
					<br>
					 <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to a Harvard study on the benefits of exercising to relax.  
				<br>
				<h2><li>Pets</li></h2>

				<p>Not only do pets reduce stress but they also reduce anxiety, depression, and loneliness.
					<br>
					<br>
					Spending time with your pet lowers cortisol levels, blood pressure, and releases oxytocin to promote a postive mood.

					Plus.........JUST LOOK AT THAT HAPPY FACE!!!!!
